# FPGASpeaks
FPGASpeaks is a community created to exchange knowledge in some of the basic domains of VLSI, i.e, Digital System Design, Verilog HDL, Hardware implementation on FPGA board, specifically  Zynq ZC706. Aim is to help people gain hands-on experience.

Work-flow

Create a GitHub repository namely "FPGAspeaks" under which you will have all your work collection.

In each level, first you need to read main.pdf, which will guide you on what and how you are supposed to do in that particular level. You need to download main.pdf to access the links mentioned in the PDF.

As you go ahead standard of each level increases. After a certain level, you should have basic-to-good knowledge of system design in verilog.

after each level, you need to do make a documentation in latex and upload in that particular level.
