# FPGASpeaks
FPGAspeaks is a community, created to exchange knowledge in some of the basic domains of VLSI i.e Digital System Design, Verilog HDL, Hardware implementation on FPGA board specifically  Zynq ZC706. Aim is to help people gain Hands-on-experience .

Work-flow
Create a Git-Hub repository namely "FPGAspeaks" under which you will all your work collection.

In each level first you need to read main.pdf which will guide you what and how you are supposed to in that particular level.

As you go ahead standard of each level increases. After certain level you should have basic-to-good knowledge of system design in verilog.

after each level you are needed to do make a documentation in latex and upload in that particular level.
